# Ethical Hacking Journal â€” Sam (Full Learning Journey)

**A living, public learning log documenting my ethical hacking journey â€” from Linux fundamentals to advanced red-teaming.**  
This repository is my single source of truth for everything I learn, build, test, and teach about offensive security and defensive thinking. It contains reproducible scripts, day-by-day notes, challenge write-ups, sanitized captures, projects, and certification prep â€” all produced in legal, controlled labs.

## What this repo is
`ethical-hacking-journal` is a chronological, technical, and verifiable record of my cybersecurity learning. Itâ€™s intentionally practical â€” not polished marketing. Each deliverable shows *what I actually did* (commands, scripts, outputs, sanitized artifacts) and *what I learned*. Over time the repo will grow from beginner content into intermediate and advanced projects.

---

## Why I keep a public journal
- **Accountability:** daily/weekly logs force regular practice.  
- **Evidence:** real outputs (scripts, writeups, PCAPs) show skill growth far better than claims.  
- **Shareability:** peers and recruiters can follow progress and give feedback.  
- **Teaching:** explaining solutions solidifies my understanding and helps others.

---

## Core principles & rules I follow
1. **Legal & ethical only.** I only test machines in lab environments or on targets where I have explicit permission.  
2. **Reproducible.** Scripts and write-ups include environment notes, exact commands, and expected outputs.  
3. **Sanitized artifacts.** No real credentials or private data in commits. PCAPs and logs are sanitized.  
4. **Incremental commits.** Small, frequent commits with meaningful messages.  
5. **Transparency.** Dates, context, and problem statements are included on each write-up.

## Phases & roadmap (overview)
This is a living roadmap â€” the contents below will evolve as I learn.

- **Phase 0 â€” Setup (Day 0)**  
  WSL / Linux install, VS Code + Remote WSL, initial tooling (`git`, `nmap`, `tcpdump`, `python3`, `vim`).

- **Phase 1 â€” Foundations (21 days)**  
  Linux & CLI mastery, basic shell scripting, OverTheWire Bandit, sysadmin basics.

- **Phase 2 â€” Networking & Enumeration (Weeks 4â€“6)**  
  TCP/IP, `nmap` scanning, `tcpdump`/Wireshark, netcat, basic service enumeration.

- **Phase 3 â€” Web & Application Security (Weeks 7â€“9)**  
  HTTP, OWASP Top 10, Juice Shop, Burp Suite basics, SQLi/XSS exploration in labs.

- **Phase 4 â€” Host Exploitation & Privilege Escalation (Weeks 10â€“13)**  
  Enumeration, common LPE vectors, linpeas/winpeas, sudo misconfigurations, kernel vectors.

- **Phase 5 â€” Post-exploitation, Persistence & Lateral Movement**  
  Credential harvesting, pivoting, persistence, and detection/defense tradeoffs.

- **Phase 6 â€” Advanced Topics & Research**  
  Reverse engineering, memory forensics, fuzzing, exploit development, red teaming.

- **Certifications & projects**  
  Track study notes for eJPT â†’ OSCP â†’ advanced certs. Build reproducible tools, papers, and demos.

(See `ROADMAP.md` for a week-by-week plan and specific deliverables.)

## How I work â€” workflow & templates
A repeatable daily workflow keeps the journal consistent and useful.

1. **Do the work** in WSL / local lab.  
2. **Log the results** immediately in `notes/day-XXX-*.md` with command history and short commentary.  
3. **Create/update writeups** for any challenge completed in `writeups/`. Include goal, environment, commands, sanitized output, and lessons learned.  
4. **Commit & push** with clear messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "day-014: finished Bandit lvl 7 â€” used find/grep; added writeup"
git push
```

### Daily note template (`notes/day-###-title.md`)

## Setup & quick start (clone + run)
```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com//ethical-hacking-journal.git
cd ethical-hacking-journal

# run system summary (example)
bash scripts/sysinfo.sh
```
**Note:** Replace `` with your GitHub handle.

---

## Recommended initial scripts
- `scripts/sysinfo.sh` â€” quick environment snapshot (hostname, uptime, memory, disks, top processes, network interfaces).  
- `scripts/netscan.sh` â€” templated `nmap` scans and output formatting.  
- `scripts/backup.sh` â€” quick backup of notes and writeups before major changes.

---

## How to contribute / collaborate
I welcome:
- Corrections to techniques and scripts.  
- PRs that add better examples or improve documentation.  
- Suggestions for new learning resources or challenge writeups.

**Before you open a PR:**
- Keep changes focused and documented.  
- Donâ€™t add secrets or raw credentials.  
- Include tests or sample runs if you add a new script.

## Final notes
This repo is intentionally public and iterative. Expect rough drafts, typos, and experimental code â€” thatâ€™s the point: itâ€™s a real record of learning by doing. If you want, I can now generate `ROADMAP.md`, populate `notes/day-001-wsl-setup.md`, or create the initial scripts (`sysinfo.sh`, `netscan.sh`) ready to paste into the `scripts/` folder.
